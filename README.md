# ML_codes
<br>
Just a bunch of codes I practiced on.
Most of the exercises currently in this file section  are taken from Andrew NG coursera's machine learning course, I am having difficulties to transfer them to notebooks since the loadmat function in the Jupyter interface causes my computer to crash (dell inspiron 7000, wtf?).
<br>
I implemented the codes in Python (The course tasks are in Matlab) and assisted on bits of codes online and added some of my own twists to it.
